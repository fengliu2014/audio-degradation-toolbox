IR_GoogleNexusOneFrontMic.wav
====================================
- recorded at studio environment at Queen Mary University of London
- method: exponential sine sweep
- Equipment:
   * Genelec ??? speaker
   * Google Nexus One phone (front microphone, Android version 2.3.6)
- Approach:
   * sine sweep was played on speaker and recorded on the phone at
     a distance of 1 meter
   * as the studio environment is not perfectly anechoic, a minor
     room impulse response is mixed in
   * impulse response was reconstructed from the recorded audio
     using inverse filtering

===============================================
- recorded using the free iZotope Vinyl (version 1.73b)
- settings (only non default):
   * year: 1960
   * warp depth, scratch, dust, elec noise, mech noise: 0   
- method: exponential sine sweep
- Approach:
   * sine sweep was sent to the plugin and the output audio was
     recorded
   * impulse response was reconstructed from the recorded audio
     using inverse filtering

===============================================
- recorded using the free iZotope Vinyl (version 1.73b)
- settings (only non default):
   * year: 1960
   * warp depth: 0
   * scratch, dust, elec noise, mech noise: 50%  
- method: recorded silence
- Approach:
   * silent signal was sent to the plugin and the output audio was
     recorded
   * the output contains sounds resembling dust, scratches, electrical
     noise and mechanical noise
